Throne Development Notes
5/4/2018
- Should we call the "Nearby" feature "Find" instead, since it takes you to that place where you can add restrooms?
- Will the "Explore" interface just be a search bar where you can enter a zipcode or address and find close by
restrooms, taking you to the same menu as the "Nearby" feature?
- Currently having trouble with the emulator. Hopefully will figure that out sooner rather than later. Can't test how things look yet, although I am at the point where I can start to add GUI elements
- Starting with Explore GUI. The Nearby GUI will be the hardest, so I'm saving it for last
